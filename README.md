# Coffee-machine
COFFEE MACHINE
This is a simple Python program that simulates a coffee machine. The program allows users to choose from three coffee drinks, check the resources, and manage the transactions. It takes user input for making orders, inserting coins, and printing reports.

HOW IT WORKS:
EXAMPLE-
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): latte
please insert coins.
how many quarters? 2
how many dimes? 1
how many nickles? 1
how many pennies? 4
Here is $1.89 change
Here is your latte.

FEATURES:
-Three Coffee Options: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino, each with specific ingredients and costs.
-Resource Management: The program checks if enough resources (water, milk, coffee) are available before making a drink.
-Coin Insertion: The user is prompted to insert coins, and the program calculates the total amount received.
-Transaction Handling: The program checks if the inserted coins cover the cost of the selected drink and provides change if necessary.
-Resource Deduction: When a drink is made, the required ingredients are deducted from the available resources.
-Report: The user can type "report" to check the available resources and the machine's profit.
